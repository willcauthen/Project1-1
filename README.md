# Project1-1

Some of you may already know the power of fiction: a potent numbing agent to ease the pain and horror of the human condition. While there is yet no cure for existential terror, I am equipped to offer you momentary relief. 

Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.



	In the world I offer, we find ourselves in a place where governance has run amok. Forced disappearances,
	censorship, incessant monitoring, and capitalistic campaigns to acquire capital at all costs have left the
	people spiritually impoverished, emotionally destitute, and finacially burdened, or so it is perceived by
	our young, idealistic narrator.

	Our young hero seeks to join the ranks of an agency calling themselves Project Mayhem, which aims to disrupt
	what they percieve as a consumerist-culture run off the rails. They employ methods of arson, assault,
	misinformation, and general mischief, but remain strictly non-lethal as a rule.

	To whence the hero ends up will be for you to decide. In this low-tech, text-based choose-your-own-adventure,
	you will take control of our unnamed protaganist as he/she traverses a complicated web of propoganda,
	destruction, and ethics.

	Choices line the road ahead. What kind of world will you build, through your actions?

Delivering high-octane mediocrity directly to your retinas, I give you:
